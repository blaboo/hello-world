Hello world!

After about 8 years of being away from coding, I have decided to begin a journey into data science.
I've started out slow, but I hope to increase the pace and fulfill my (current) dream of mastering data analysis and computation-aided insight and hopefully bring something new to the world of natural sciences.
My current target areas of impact include pharmaceutical chemistry, the human genome, and health care.
Challenge accepted!
